              Our machine learning algorithm is trained with cutting edge
              technology, which has only become possible in recent years. With
              only the addition of software, cBMI can accurately estimate body
              mass index (BMI) from facial photos off of any camera.

              Our team has built the largest known data set of labeled images
              for BMI. The accuracy we achieve is only possible with the raw
              scale of our verified, labeled images.

              For sustained weight management it is so critical to maintain
              accountabiilty at all times -- frequent check-ins can mean the
              difference between weight loss and stagnation. A solution
              available on every smartphone an laptop means no excuses for
              fogetting to weigh in, itâ€™s as easy as a notification and can be
              done wherever the day takes you.
